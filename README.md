# 21_Fall_project_gabbishSorting

Hi. This is a message left by a team consists of five sophomores in Sustech. 
This is a semester project, aiming to build a robot to help raise people's awareness of resorting gabbish. 

There are several files here. If you want to follow our work, plz pay much attention to files 'GUI_resource' and 'picture_resource'. They are combined closely to work well.
The file 'Test_code' is insignificant, just ignore it if you dont want to check the parts.

A file named 'Control_movement' includes the code to control the chassis.

If you have any question, plz contact me under 11911421@mail.sustech.edu.cn
